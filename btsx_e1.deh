YOU HAVE ENTERED DEEPLY INTO THE INFESTED
STARPORT. BUT SOMETHING IS WRONG. THE
MONSTERS HAVE BROUGHT THEIR OWN REALITY
WITH THEM, AND THE STARPORT'S TECHNOLOGY
IS BEING SUBVERTED BY THEIR PRESENCE.

AHEAD, YOU SEE AN OUTPOST OF HELL, A
FORTIFIED ZONE. IF YOU CAN GET PAST IT,
YOU CAN PENETRATE INTO THE HAUNTED HEART
OF THE STARBASE AND FIND THE CONTROLLING
SWITCH WHICH HOLDS EARTH'S POPULATION
HOSTAGE.Much like the horrors trapped within, the
once-dead station is teeming with life. The
garrison lies in shambles, and all around
the hunting ground, the dead are on
display. A tenement filled with sideshow
freaks with bloodshot eyes, razor sharp
teeth, and hungry smiles.

It all be damned, yet I still press on.
Why can't a recon mission ever be simple?

YOU HAVE WON! YOUR VICTORY HAS ENABLED
HUMANKIND TO EVACUATE EARTH AND ESCAPE
THE NIGHTMARE.  NOW YOU ARE THE ONLY
HUMAN LEFT ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET.
CANNIBAL MUTATIONS, CARNIVOROUS ALIENS,
AND EVIL SPIRITS ARE YOUR ONLY NEIGHBORS.
YOU SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR DEATH, CONTENT
THAT YOU HAVE SAVED YOUR SPECIES.

BUT THEN, EARTH CONTROL BEAMS DOWN A
MESSAGE FROM SPACE: "SENSORS HAVE LOCATED
THE SOURCE OF THE ALIEN INVASION. IF YOU
GO THERE, YOU MAY BE ABLE TO BLOCK THEIR
ENTRY.  THE ALIEN BASE IS IN THE HEART OF
YOUR OWN HOME CITY, NOT FAR FROM THE
STARPORT." SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY YOU GET
UP AND RETURN TO THE FRAY.In the midst, I pause a moment to arrange
the data thus far collected. The ghastly
picture it paints is rife with failed
experiments, culminating in a peak of
mystery surrounding a shrouded project.
Referenced by no name, the enigma on the
dark side of Saturn X lives within ancient
ruins and a sea of rust.

It is all a tangent. The pressing threat
of invasion demands my return. A counter-
attack must be signaled, and when the
colossus crawls west I shall make my
escape. Sights set on the communication
centre, I march forward.
Gather these familiar shadows; I will
take them on.

YOU ARE AT THE CORRUPT HEART OF THE CITY,
SURROUNDED BY THE CORPSES OF YOUR ENEMIES.
YOU SEE NO WAY TO DESTROY THE CREATURES'
ENTRYWAY ON THIS SIDE, SO YOU CLENCH YOUR
TEETH AND PLUNGE THROUGH IT.

THERE MUST BE A WAY TO CLOSE IT ON THE
OTHER SIDE. WHAT DO YOU CARE IF YOU'VE
GOT TO GO THROUGH HELL TO GET TO IT?The comm station whirrs to life. I relay
the hopeless cause, yet my reward is
unsubstantial. I am instructed to secure
transport to the far side and investigate.

A vast expanse of ocean blocks my path.
Luck withstanding, there should still be
a ship in port somewhere.

Last chance to escape...

CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'VE FOUND THE SECRET
LEVEL! LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN BUILT BY
HUMANS, RATHER THAN DEMONS. YOU WONDER
WHO THE INMATES OF THIS CORNER OF HELL
WILL BE.Who thought it was a good idea to power
a mainframe network with radiation from
exposed waste? Isn't that taking
efficiency too far?

Now we play optical hopscotch!
