YOU HAVE ENTERED DEEPLY INTO THE INFESTED
STARPORT. BUT SOMETHING IS WRONG. THE
MONSTERS HAVE BROUGHT THEIR OWN REALITY
WITH THEM, AND THE STARPORT'S TECHNOLOGY
IS BEING SUBVERTED BY THEIR PRESENCE.

AHEAD, YOU SEE AN OUTPOST OF HELL, A
FORTIFIED ZONE. IF YOU CAN GET PAST IT,
YOU CAN PENETRATE INTO THE HAUNTED HEART
OF THE STARBASE AND FIND THE CONTROLLING
SWITCH WHICH HOLDS EARTH'S POPULATION
HOSTAGE.THE DARK COLONY OF SATURN X REMAINS -
AN ERRATIC BACKWATER CONSTELLATION OF
CRUMBLING RUINS AND VANISHING TECHNOLOGY.
YET HERE IN THE COLD AND FILTHY CHASM,
WHERE LIGHT-REVEALING HOLY GRAILS STILL
WAR WITH THE GOD OF SHADOWS, A HIDDEN
TOWER IS SEALED BENEATH A STILL AND
FESTERING MOON. THE STUDDED CROWN ON A
DYING PLANET. THE THIEF OF SOULS.

THIS GAME WE PLAY. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
A MIRACLE OR A CURSE.

YOU HAVE WON! YOUR VICTORY HAS ENABLED
HUMANKIND TO EVACUATE EARTH AND ESCAPE
THE NIGHTMARE.  NOW YOU ARE THE ONLY
HUMAN LEFT ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET.
CANNIBAL MUTATIONS, CARNIVOROUS ALIENS,
AND EVIL SPIRITS ARE YOUR ONLY NEIGHBORS.
YOU SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR DEATH, CONTENT
THAT YOU HAVE SAVED YOUR SPECIES.

BUT THEN, EARTH CONTROL BEAMS DOWN A
MESSAGE FROM SPACE: "SENSORS HAVE LOCATED
THE SOURCE OF THE ALIEN INVASION. IF YOU
GO THERE, YOU MAY BE ABLE TO BLOCK THEIR
ENTRY.  THE ALIEN BASE IS IN THE HEART OF
YOUR OWN HOME CITY, NOT FAR FROM THE
STARPORT." SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY YOU GET
UP AND RETURN TO THE FRAY.I HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE MALICE, BUT
IT HAD NOT FORGOTTEN ME. WHAT IS THIS
CONTRAPTION?
THE FOG OF NIGHTMARE DISSIPATES TO REVEAL
A HORRIBLE REALITY, WHERE STREAKS OF
MOCKING LIGHT IMPALE THE SKY, AND BROKEN
CITIES SWOLLEN WITH THE CRAWL OF EVIL LURK.
THE DEMONS ARE REAL NOW. THEY HAD MOVED
AROUND AS VESTIGES UNDER THE VEIL OF
SHADOW, BUT NOW THEY WILL SCRATCH AND
CLAW AND HATE UNTIL THE END, WITH ME AS
THEIR WITNESS. IT'S TIME TO DRAW A LINE.

AHEAD IS ANOTHER PATH - A LONELY MILE -
TAKING ME DEEPER INTO THE LABYRINTH OF THE
TWISTED MECHANISM. THE FOUNTAIN OF FIRE
LIES DORMANT, WAITING FOR THE SPARK.      

Text 312 313
YOU ARE AT THE CORRUPT HEART OF THE CITY,
SURROUNDED BY THE CORPSES OF YOUR ENEMIES.
YOU SEE NO WAY TO DESTROY THE CREATURES'
ENTRYWAY ON THIS SIDE, SO YOU CLENCH YOUR
TEETH AND PLUNGE THROUGH IT.

THERE MUST BE A WAY TO CLOSE IT ON THE
OTHER SIDE. WHAT DO YOU CARE IF YOU'VE
GOT TO GO THROUGH HELL TO GET TO IT?IT IS AN INCINERATION. THE PLANET IS PRIMED
TO BURN BENEATH THE LOOM, AND THE PORTAL IS
THE ONLY WAY OFF IT. BUT STARING OUT FROM
OTHERWORLDLY WINDOWS, THE TASK THAT LIES
BEFORE ME IS NOW MORE REAL THAN DEATH, AND
I KNOW THERE IS NO TURNING BACK.

THE WAY IS NOW OPEN. THE GHOSTS OF A
DIFFERENT DREAM ARE WAITING.

CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'VE FOUND THE SECRET
LEVEL! LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN BUILT BY
HUMANS, RATHER THAN DEMONS. YOU WONDER
WHO THE INMATES OF THIS CORNER OF HELL
WILL BE.PERHAPS YOU HAD READ IT, ONCE. WRITTEN IN
BLOOD PASSED DOWN THROUGH AGES. BUT DEEP
DOWN INSIDE, YOU KNOW YOU WILL BURN FOR
THIS...

ENJOY YOUR FATE, YOU SINISTER COD!
